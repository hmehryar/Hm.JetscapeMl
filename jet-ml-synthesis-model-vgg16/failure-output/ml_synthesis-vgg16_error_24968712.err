DEPRECATION: pandas 0.24.2 has a non-standard dependency specifier pytz>=2011k. pip 23.3 will enforce this behaviour change. A possible replacement is to upgrade to a newer version of pandas or contact the author to suggest that they release a version with a conforming dependency specifiers. Discussion can be found at https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12063

[notice] A new release of pip is available: 18.1 -> 23.3
