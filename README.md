## Introduction

Hm.JetscapeMl is a project aimed at applying machine learning methods to analyze data from Jetscape simulations, a toolkit used for simulating the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. The goal is to extract valuable insights and patterns from the simulation data using modern machine learning techniques.

## Installation

To get started with Hm.JetscapeMl, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmehryar/Hm.JetscapeMl.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

```bash
cd Hm.JetscapeMl
```

3. Install the required dependencies. It's recommended to set up a virtual environment before installing dependencies:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
