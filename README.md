## Introduction

Hm.JetscapeMl is a project aimed at applying machine learning methods to analyze data from Jetscape simulations, a toolkit used for simulating the quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions. The goal is to extract valuable insights and patterns from the simulation data using modern machine learning techniques.

## Installation

To get started with Hm.JetscapeMl, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hmehryar/Hm.JetscapeMl.git
```

2. Navigate to the repository's directory:

```bash
cd Hm.JetscapeMl
```
3. Reading the Dataset: To read and utilize the dataset, users can employ various tools and libraries compatible with the pickle format. Hereâ€™s how the dataset can be accessed using Python with the `pickle` library:

```bash
import pickle
dataset_file_name = f"ml_jet_dataset.pkl"
try:
    with open(file_name, 'rb') as dataset_file:
        loaded_data = pickle.load(dataset_file, encoding='latin1')
        (dataset_x, dataset_y) = loaded_data
        print("dataset_x:",type(dataset_x), dataset_x.size, dataset_x.shape)
        print("dataset_y:",type(dataset_y), dataset_y.size,dataset_y.shape)
except pickle.UnpicklingError as e:
        print("Error while loading the pickle file:", e)
```


## Usage
Once you have the repository set up and the dependencies installed, you can start utilizing the project:
1. Data Preprocessing: Use the provided scripts to preprocess and prepare Jetscape simulation data for analysis.
2. Machine Learning Models: Explore the models directory to find pre-implemented machine learning models tailored for analyzing Jetscape data.
3. Example Notebooks: Check out the notebooks directory for example Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use the machine learning models with Jetscape data.
4. Customization: Feel free to customize and extend the code to suit your specific needs and experiments.
